## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are analysing data from the Maryland Lobbying Registrations. [https://lobby-ethics.maryland.gov/]

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the tidyverse here

## Load and Cleaning Data

```{r}
# Load required data

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

one <- read_csv("data/registrations(1).csv") %>% clean_names()
two <- read_csv("data/registrations(2).csv") %>% clean_names()
three <- read_csv("data/registrations(3).csv") %>% clean_names()
four<- read_csv("data/registrations(4).csv") %>% clean_names()
five <- read_csv("data/registrations(5).csv")%>% clean_names()
six <- read_csv("data/registrations(6).csv")%>% clean_names()

eight <- read_csv("data/registrations(8).csv")%>% clean_names()
nine <- read_csv("data/registrations(9).csv")%>% clean_names()
```
**rbind is how you combine multiple dataframes.


```{r}
# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 

total_registrations <- rbind(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
write_csv(total_registrations, "data/total_registrations.csv")

clean_total_registrations <- read_csv("data/clean_total_registrations.csv")
clean_total_registrations[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(clean_total_registrations$registration_period, '-', 2)

```

*How many rows & columns?
*What are limitations & flaws?

From accessing the Maryland Lobbying Registrations website, we downloaded 9 CSVs of registration data points. We then cleaned each individually and binded them together to create a comprehensive cleaned CSV and data set. We added cleaned columns for organization name & employer and split the date column to have a start and end date for the registration. Our comprehensive, cleaned data set includes 26,580 rows and 10 columns including form_id for a registration number, lobbyist_registrant for the name of the lobbyist, clean_lobbyist_registrant for a standardized list of the lobbyists by name, organization_firm for the name of the organization the lobbyist works for, clean_organization_firm for a standardized list of the organizations the lobbyists work for, employer for what company hired the lobbyist, clean_employer for a standardized list of companies that hired their corresponding lobbyist, registration_period for the registration period that lobbyist was registered to lobby on behalf of the company listed, start for the start date of the registration period and end for the end of the registration period. Our earliest listed start date is January 1, 2016 and our most recent listed end date is December 31, 2021.

After we merged the data sets into total_registrations, we exported a CSV file of the information and cleaned the data in OpenRefine. There only remained a handful of names that were formatted slightly differently that we needed to clean before exporting the now cleaned CSV back to RStudio where we created the cleaned name columns and the individual start and end date columns.

Limitations: The dataframe is pretty basic with a small number of columns. That means we will have to cross-reference the Maryland Lobbying Registrations and other external websites if we want to know how much a lobbyist is making or how much an employer is spending on lobbying. The standard dataset doesn't even include the registration matters. For our topical questions such as energy, crime or the environment, we have to download new datasets for every registration matter we're interested in. On the Maryland Lobbying Registrations website, they provide a search tool titled "Registration Matters" where you can search registrations by the category/topic. For our special topics, we're downloading the CSV files from their pre-defined "Energy," "Environment," and "Juvenile Law" categories online. Another limitation is that the earliest data is from 2016, which means we can't look at any trends that surpass 6 years.

To answer most of our questions, we will have to do additional research. For example, we can ask our data for the number of employers and lobbyists in the energy sector and see how that changed over the last few years. To examine how much the top firms make, we have to go back to Maryland Lobbying Registrations and potentially research beyond just the single website.

When looking into the Prince George's County youth curfew question, we won't get clear cut answers from the data alone. Trying to find a connection between the number of lobbyists for matters of juvenile law and the implementation of the curfew will require additional research on our part, but we can ask our data for trends and basic information that can help shape our research.

### Question 1
* **Question text**:What lobbyist/registrant represents the most employers in our data set? (Most ever, need all data)

* **Analysis summary**:*Analysis summary**:  The lobbyist that represents the most employers in our data set was Timothy A. Perry. He's been representing employers for 12 years as a member of Perry White Ross Jacobson LLC and served as Chief of Staff to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., the longest serving State Senate President in United States history. He lives in Baltimore County, Maryland, and has represented 126 distinct employers in our joined data set. He's represented employers such as Stevenson University and AT&T over four of our data cycles. According to a profile written about him in September 2022, he specializes in government relations and serves as a board member of First Fruits Farm, a charitable nonprofit organization that specializes in food services.

### Question 3

In the months leading up to the September 9th youth curfew in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, was there an increase in the amount of lobbyist registered for matters of juvenile law?

Revised question: How did the number of Criminal Law Procedure lobbyists registered change after the September 9th youth curfew in Prince George's County?

Answer: The number of lobbyists that registered on or after September, 01 2021 through August 2022 for Criminal Law Procedure was 25 (24 were from September 2021 to February 2022). From September, 01 2022 through November 2022, there were 19 registered lobbyists for Criminal Law Procedure.

I changed the initial question because based on the data that I choose, I didn't see how I would be able to see if there was a month by month increase or decrease. I also noticed that from March 2022 to August 2022, there were only two lobbyists registered during that period of time. So I though that I should create a question that allows me to incorporate more data than just two lobbyists. 

I also decided to take a look at the lobbyists who most recently registered to see if they had been registered in the past. ACLU of Maryland, which is known for fighting for equal rights for Maryland residents, was one of the groups that registered in November 2022. However, the organization's recent lobbying registration is not due to the PG curfew, as they have consistently be registered as lobbyists since 2019. If it were due to the PG curfew, then we'd probably see more registered lobbyists connected to the organization. The same lobbyist, Yanet Amanuel, has been registered with the organization since 2019.

I noticed that the organization Jews United For Justice hired a lobbyist for the first time on November 1, 2022. The organization "advances economic, racial, and social justice in the Baltimore-Washington region by educating and mobilizing our local Jewish communities to action." People like Kanye West and Kyrie Irving have made the news lately due to Antisemitic posts and remarks that they have made. I think that it may be possible that current events may have encouraged the organization to register. The organization The Anti-Defamation League works to stop the defamation of Jewish people and has consistently had a lobbyist associated with it since 2020.

#Read in criminal procedure data, split the dates column into start and end periods. The next section of code then puts both the start and end dates in month, day,and year format. The results are grouped by the name of the lobbyists.

```{r}
Criminal_Prod<- read_csv("data/CriminalLProd.csv") %>% clean_names()
Criminal_Prod[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(Criminal_Prod$registration_period, '-', 2)

NewCriminal_Prod <- Criminal_Prod %>% 
mutate(new_start = as.Date(start, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(new_end = as.Date(end, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(start_year = floor_date(new_start, "year")) %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant)
```

#Next I created new dataframes to seperate the time periods to find out what how the registration data changes after Spetember 9, 2022. I created dataframes for September 2021 to Feburary 2022 (SeptoFeb), March 2022 to August 2022 (March22toAug), and September 2022 to November 2022 (Sept22toNov). I filtered the dates from the start period column to find registrants that were registered at the beginning of each time period. 

Compare: March2022 through August 2022 to September 2021 to February 2022

```{r}
SepttoFeb <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
filter(new_start == "2021-11-08" | new_start == "2021-11-01" |
new_start == "2022-02-08" | new_start == "2022-01-01" | new_start == "2021-12-06" | new_start == "2022-01-12" | new_start == "2022-01-24")
  
March22toAug <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(new_start == "2022-05-18" | new_start == "2022-08-11")

Sept22toNov <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(new_start == "2022-11-01" | new_start == "2022-11-07" | new_start == "2022-11-11" | new_start == "2022-11-02")
```

#To see the distinct number of lobbyists registered during each time period, I created new dataframes for each of the time periods, then counted the distinct number of lobbyists for each time period. 

```{r}
CountSepttoFeb <- SepttoFeb %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))

CountMarch22toAug <- March22toAug %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))

CountSept22toNov <- Sept22toNov %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))
```

#To see if if any recent Criminal Law Procedure Lobbyists were previously registered as Criminal Law Procedure Lobbyists, I went back to the inital dataset where I split the start and end dates. I then looked at the 19 names for the September 2022 to November 2022 dataset to see the most recent registrants. I filtered them from the bigger data and created a new dataframe (CrimeRecentReg). Any names that were duplicated from this list are the people who were previously registered. 

```{r}
CrimRecentReg <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_registrant == "Amanuel, Yanet" | lobbyist_registrant == "Bellamy, Lorenzo" | lobbyist_registrant == "Carrington, J. Darrell"|lobbyist_registrant == "Ciekot, Ann T." |lobbyist_registrant == "Egan, Ashley" | lobbyist_registrant == "Elliott, Robyn S" | lobbyist_registrant == "Hessler, Therese Marie" | lobbyist_registrant == "Jones, Lisa" | lobbyist_registrant == "Kraska, Martin" | lobbyist_registrant == "Lennig, Dorothy J" | lobbyist_registrant == "Lombardi, Joyce" | lobbyist_registrant == "Malone, Sean R" | lobbyist_registrant == "Manno, Roger" | lobbyist_registrant == "Mansfield, Andrea" | lobbyist_registrant == "McDonough, Caitlin E" | lobbyist_registrant == "Shapiro, Melanie" | lobbyist_registrant == "Tompsett Jr., Thomas R." | lobbyist_registrant == "Weisel, Meredith R." | lobbyist_registrant == "Zeimer, Matan")
```

#Any lobbyists that were registered from September 2021 to Feburary 2022 that were not previously registered? 

```{r}
CrimeLaterReg <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_registrant == "Amanuel, Yanet" | lobbyist_registrant == "Bellamy, Lorenzo" | lobbyist_registrant == "Chu, Sarah" |
 lobbyist_registrant == "Ciekot, Ann T."| lobbyist_registrant == "Dews, Christopher" |lobbyist_registrant == "Doherty, Michael J"|lobbyist_registrant == "Dold, James Lee" | lobbyist_registrant == "Egan, Ashley" | lobbyist_registrant == "Erb, Nathaniel" | lobbyist_registrant == "Jones, Lisa" | lobbyist_registrant == "Jordan, Lisae C" | lobbyist_registrant == "Kraska, Martin" | lobbyist_registrant == "Lennig, Dorothy J"| lobbyist_registrant == "Malone, Sean R" | lobbyist_registrant == "Manno, Roger" | lobbyist_registrant == "Mansfield, Andrea" | lobbyist_registrant == "Nalley, Justin" | lobbyist_registrant == "Shapiro, Melanie" | lobbyist_registrant == "Shewbridge, Rylie Elizabeth" | lobbyist_registrant == "Snyder, Gregory  Michael, Jr." | lobbyist_registrant == "Stierhoff, John R." | lobbyist_registrant == "Tompsett Jr., Thomas R." | lobbyist_registrant == "Weisel, Meredith R." | lobbyist_registrant == "Zirkin, Robert Alan")

```

Who are the recent registrants among both the most current time period?

-Most recent = September 2022 to November 2022

Answer: The most recent criminal law procedure lobbyists registrants that were not previously registered in this category before were Carrington, J. Darrell, Elliott, Robyn S, Hessler, Therese Marie, Lombardi, Joyce, McDonough, Caitlin E, Zeimer, Matan.

-September 2021 to Feb. 2022 

-The new lobbyists in the criminal procedure data from September 2021 to February 2022 were Chu, Sarah (Innocence Project), Dold, James Lee (Human Rights for Kids), Shewbridge, Rylie Elizabeth (Bellamy Genn Group LLC/ Organize Black), and Snyder, Gregory  Michael, Jr.(Bellamy Genn Group LLC/ Organize Black).

Do any of the recently registered criminal procedure lobbyists have the same employers? 

Some of the recently registered lobbyists also had the same employer. Both Yanet and Lorenzo had the ACLU of Maryland as their employer. Lisa, Dorthy J, Sean R, Catlin E, and Thomas R had the House of Ruth Maryland as their employer. The only person whose employer was the Jews United for Justice was Matan. 

Question 4
**Question text**: How did the number of employers and lobbyists registered for "energy" change from 2018 to 2022?

Starting with the basic analysis of lobbyist registrations categorized under the registration matter "energy", we want to explore lobbying efforts in the energy sector. Follow-up questions include: Which firms had the most employers in our time frame? How much money did the top 3 firms make from employers in the energy sector (in 2022)? Who are their employers? Are they part of fossil fuels, clean energy or others?

Limitations: Although the general dataset on registrations goes back to 2016, datasets including the registration matter only go back to 2019. The general dataset also only goes through the end of 2021 while the energy dataset has information through November of 2022.

**Analysis summary**: As our data shows, 106 lobbyists have registered for "energy" in 1019, 132 in 2020, 123 in 2021 and 2022 in 115. One could have assumed that since the climate crisis has been big news in recent years that there would have been more lobbyists, which doesn't seem to be the case. The numbers has been reclining since 2020. Since 2020 was the first pandemic year, there could be a connection. Did employers have less money to spend on lobbying?

Interestingly, while the number of lobbyists declined, the number of employers grew before 2022. In 2019 there were 66 employers, in 2020 88, in 2021 85 and in 2022 there were 78 employers in the registration matter category "energy".

The 3 firms with the most employers registered for energy lobbying since 2019 are:
- Compass Government Relations Partners, LLC (10 employers)
- Perry White Ross & Jacobson (8 employers)
- Rifkin Weiner Livingston LLC (8 employers)

We've found that Exxon Mobil Corporation appears as an employer for the first time in 2022. This is already interesting, as Exxon is a huge player in the energy sector. Also, according to his report, the lobbyist received $0: https://lobby-ethics.maryland.gov/lobbyist_registrations/6308010abf04d6058af6ddc8/activity_reports/630cbaa7bf04d6058b1e0418

Further research on the MSEC website shows that Exxon has appeared in different categories on the past, "Environment" and "Others".

## The dataset has been cleaned in OpenRefine. We clean the names and split the date column, so we have a start and an end date for the registration.

Question 5

**Question text**: Who were the top earners of the latest complete lobbying year (Nov 21 - Oct 22) and who were the employers that spent the most money?

In the MSEC activity reports, lobbyists have to report the compensation they have received. The employers state their total expenses.

Limitations: While the data for lobbyist registrations can be filtered by registration matter, the same isn't possibly for the activity reports.

**Analysis summary**

Matthew Celentano is by far the top earner for the latest complete lobbying year (Nov 21 - Oct 22). He was compensated over 100 million dollars by the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, Inc. Celentano works for the firm Funk & Bolton, P.A.. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is also the executive director of League of Life, which is a trade association for the insurance industry. (Unsurprisingly, League of Life is the employer that spent the most money in this lobbying year. It's the only employer spending over a million. Second place goes to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC, which spent over $800,000.)

That seems a little suspicious. We are wondering, if that is a legal and common business practice or if there might be something going on worth investigating.

12 lobbyists made over a million, while 174 made less than one thousand dollars, 131 of those were compensated $0.

Maryland Veterinary Medical Association	spend the least money of all employers with just over $18,000.


## The activity reports can't be filtered by energy registrations, but we want to know which lobbyist made the most money in the reporting period November 21 - October 22 and which employer spent the most money on lobbying.


## We fix the date

```{r}
activity_reports <- read_csv("data/activity_reports_nov_21_oct_22.csv") %>% clean_names()
activity_reports[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(activity_reports$reporting_period, '-', 2)
activity_reports <- activity_reports %>% 
  mutate(new_start = as.Date(start, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(new_end = as.Date(end, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(start_year = floor_date(new_start, "year"))
activity_reports
```

```{r}
## And transform the relevant columns to numeric
clean_activity_reports <- activity_reports %>% 
  mutate(total_expenses = gsub(",","",total_expenses)) %>% 
  mutate(total_expenses = str_remove(total_expenses, "[$]")) %>% 
  mutate(total_expenses = as.numeric(total_expenses)) %>% 
  mutate(lobbyist_compensation = gsub(",","",lobbyist_compensation)) %>% 
  mutate(lobbyist_compensation = str_remove(lobbyist_compensation, "[$]")) %>% 
  mutate(lobbyist_compensation = as.numeric(lobbyist_compensation))
clean_activity_reports
```

```{r}
## Now we want to see the top earners among the lobbyists
top_lobbyists <- clean_activity_reports %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(lobbyist_compensation = sum(lobbyist_compensation)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lobbyist_compensation))
top_lobbyists
```

```{r}
over_million <- top_lobbyists %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_compensation > 1000000)
over_million
```

```{r}
less_thousand <- top_lobbyists %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_compensation < 1000)
less_thousand
```

```{r}
zero <- top_lobbyists %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_compensation == 0)
zero

```

```{r}
celentano <- clean_activity_reports %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_registrant == "Celentano, Matthew")
celentano
```

```{r}
## Now we want to know which employers spend the most money
top_employers <- clean_activity_reports %>% 
  group_by(employer) %>% 
  summarise(total_expenses = sum(total_expenses)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_expenses))
top_employers
```

We think the most newsworthy finding is that Matthew Celentano is the top earner from the lobbyists. He earned more than $100 million by the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, Inc. It's questionable that he's earned this much as a lobbyist and that an organization is paying that much for an lobbyist. It's also suspicious that Celentano is earning so much from the League of Life as a lobbyist and that he also has an official position there as a Executive Director. We think that this could be worth looking more into if this is not a considered a common business practice.
