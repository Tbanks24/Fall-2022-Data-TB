## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are reverse engineering the story, [STORY NAME](STORY URL)

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)


```

## Load and Cleaning Data

In this section, describe the source of the data, write a basic data dictionary for data you are working with, and discuss any caveats or issues you discovered working with this data. 

```{r}
# Load required data

nonvoters_data <- read_csv('data/nonvoters_data.csv')

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 


```

## Sentences to Engineer
In this notebook, we are reverse engineering five sentences from the story.

### Sentence 1

* **Sentence text**: Nonvoters were more likely to have lower incomes; to be young; to have lower levels of education; and to say they donâ€™t belong to either political party, which are all traits that square with what we know about people less likely to engage with the political system. 

```{r}




```


* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

cate_nonvoters <- nonvoters_data %>% 
mutate(
  Q30 = case_when( 
  Q30 >= 3 ~ "neither party",
Q30 == 2 ~ "Democrat",
  Q30 == 1 ~"Republican",
)) %>% 
mutate(
  ppage = case_when(
ppage <= 24 ~ "18-24",
ppage > 24 ~ "older than 24"))

cate_nonvoters %>% 
  summarise(income_cat, educ, Q30, voter_category, ppage)


# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 2

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

```

### Sentence 3

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 4

* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here

# Display results of code below this codeblock

```

### Sentence 5

* **Sentence text**: [Paste in sentence to engineer here]
* **Analysis summary**: [Write up two to three sentences describing the results of your analysis.  Were you able to confirm the finding? If not, why not?]

```{r}
# Put code to reverse engineer sentence here
