## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are analysing data from the Maryland Lobbying Registrations. [https://lobby-ethics.maryland.gov/]

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the tidyverse here
library(tidyverse)
# Load janitor here
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

```{r}
# Load required data

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

one <- read_csv("data/registrations(1).csv") %>% clean_names()
two <- read_csv("data/registrations(2).csv") %>% clean_names()
three <- read_csv("data/registrations(3).csv") %>% clean_names()
four<- read_csv("data/registrations(4).csv") %>% clean_names()
five <- read_csv("data/registrations(5).csv")%>% clean_names()
six <- read_csv("data/registrations(6).csv")%>% clean_names()
seven <- read_csv("data/registrations(7).csv")%>% clean_names()
eight <- read_csv("data/registrations(8).csv")%>% clean_names()
nine <- read_csv("data/registrations(9).csv")%>% clean_names()
```
**rbind is how you combine multiple dataframes.


```{r}
# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 

total_registrations <- rbind(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
write_csv(total_registrations, "data/total_registrations.csv")

clean_total_registrations <- read_csv("data/clean_total_registrations.csv")
clean_total_registrations[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(clean_total_registrations$registration_period, '-', 2)

```

## Basic explorations

*How many rows & columns?
*What are limitations & flaws?

From accessing the Maryland Lobbying Registrations website, we downloaded 9 CSVs of registration data points. We then cleaned each individually and binded them together to create a comprehensive cleaned CSV and data set. We added cleaned columns for organization name & employer and split the date column to have a start and end date for the registration. Our comprehensive, cleaned data set includes 26,580 rows and 10 columns including form_id for a registration number, lobbyist_registrant for the name of the lobbyist, clean_lobbyist_registrant for a standardized list of the lobbyists by name, organization_firm for the name of the organization the lobbyist works for, clean_organization_firm for a standardized list of the organizations the lobbyists work for, employer for what company hired the lobbyist, clean_employer for a standardized list of companies that hired their corresponding lobbyist, registration_period for the registration period that lobbyist was registered to lobby on behalf of the company listed, start for the start date of the registration period and end for the end of the registration period. Our earliest listed start date is January 1, 2016 and our most recent listed end date is December 31, 2021.

After we merged the data sets into total_registrations, we exported a CSV file of the information and cleaned the data in OpenRefine. There only remained a handful of names that were formatted slightly differently that we needed to clean before exporting the now cleaned CSV back to RStudio where we created the cleaned name columns and the individual start and end date columns.

Limitations: The dataframe is pretty basic with a small number of columns. That means we will have to cross-reference the Maryland Lobbying Registrations and other external websites if we want to know how much a lobbyist is making or how much an employer is spending on lobbying. The standard dataset doesn't even include the registration matters. For our topical questions such as energy, crime or the environment, we have to download new datasets for every registration matter we're interested in. On the Maryland Lobbying Registrations website, they provide a search tool titled "Registration Matters" where you can search registrations by the category/topic. For our special topics, we're downloading the CSV files from their pre-defined "Energy," "Environment," and "Juvenile Law" categories online. Another limitation is that the earliest data is from 2016, which means we can't look at any trends that surpass 6 years.

To answer most of our questions, we will have to do additional research. For example, we can ask our data for the number of employers and lobbyists in the energy sector and see how that changed over the last few years. To examine how much the top firms make, we have to go back to Maryland Lobbying Registrations and potentially research beyond just the single website.

When looking into the Prince George's County youth curfew question, we won't get clear cut answers from the data alone. Trying to find a connection between the number of lobbyists for matters of juvenile law and the implementation of the curfew will require additional research on our part, but we can ask our data for trends and basic information that can help shape our research.

### Question 1
* **Question text**:What lobbyist/registrant represents the most employers in our data set? (Most ever, need all data)

* **Analysis summary**:*Analysis summary**:  The lobbyist that represents the most employers in our data set was Timothy A. Perry. He's been representing employers for 12 years as a member of Perry White Ross Jacobson LLC and served as Chief of Staff to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., the longest serving State Senate President in United States history. He lives in Baltimore County, Maryland, and has represented 126 distinct employers in our joined data set. He's represented employers such as Stevenson University and AT&T over four of our data cycles. According to a profile written about him in September 2022, he specializes in government relations and serves as a board member of First Fruits Farm, a charitable nonprofit organization that specializes in food services.

### Question 3

In the months leading up to the September 9th youth curfew in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, was there an increase in the amount of lobbyist registered for matters of juvenile law?

Revised question: How did the number of Criminal Law Procedure lobbyists registered change after the September 9th youth curfew in Prince George's County? 

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

Criminal Law Procedure data set

```{r}
Criminal_Prod<- read_csv("data/CriminalLProd.csv") %>% clean_names()
Criminal_Prod[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(Criminal_Prod$registration_period, '-', 2)

NewCriminal_Prod <- Criminal_Prod %>% 
mutate(new_start = as.Date(start, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(new_end = as.Date(end, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(start_year = floor_date(new_start, "year")) %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant)
```
Compare: March2022 through August 2022 to September 2021 to February 2022

```{r}
SepttoFeb <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
filter(new_start == "2021-11-08" | new_start == "2021-11-01" |
new_start == "2022-02-08" | new_start == "2022-01-01" | new_start == "2021-12-06" | new_start == "2022-01-12" | new_start == "2022-01-24")
  
March22toAug <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(new_start == "2022-05-18" | new_start == "2022-08-11")

Sept22toNov <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(new_start == "2022-11-01" | new_start == "2022-11-07" | new_start == "2022-11-11" | new_start == "2022-11-02")
```

```{r}
CountSepttoFeb <- SepttoFeb %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))

CountMarch22toAug <- March22toAug %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))

CountSept22toNov <- Sept22toNov %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))
```

The number of lobbyists that registered on or after September, 01 2021 through August 2022 for Criminal Law Procedure was 25 (24 were from September 2021 to February 2022). From September, 01 2022 through November 2022, there were 19 registered lobbyists for Criminal Law Procedure.

I changed the initial question because based on the data that I choose, I didn't see how I would be able to see if there was a month by month increase or decrease. I also noticed that from March 2022 to August 2022, there were only two lobbyists registered during that period of time. So I though that I should create a question that allows me to incorporate more data than just two lobbyists. 

Now that we know how the number of lobbyists has changed, it would be interesting to conduct more research and see if any of them have a connection to PG County at all. 

Question 4
**Question text**: How did the number of employers and lobbyists registered for "energy" change from 2018 to 2022?

Starting with the basic analysis of lobbyist registrations categorized under the registration matter "energy", we want to explore lobbying efforts in the energy sector. Follow-up questions include: Which firms had the most employers in our time frame? How much money did the top 3 firms make from employers in the energy sector (in 2022)? Who are their employers? Are they part of fossil fuels, clean energy or others?

Limitations: Although the general dataset on registrations goes back to 2016, datasets including the registration matter only go back to 2019. The general dataset also only goes through the end of 2021 while the energy dataset has information through November of 2022.

**Analysis summary**: As our data shows, 106 lobbyists have registered for "energy" in 1019, 132 in 2020, 123 in 2021 and 2022 in 115. One could have assumed that since the climate crisis has been big news in recent years that there would have been more lobbyists, which doesn't seem to be the case. The numbers has been reclining since 2020. Since 2020 was the first pandemic year, there could be a connection. Did employers have less money to spend on lobbying?

Interestingly, while the number of lobbyists declined, the number of employers grew before 2022. In 2019 there were 66 employers, in 2020 88, in 2021 85 and in 2022 there were 78 employers in the registration matter category "energy".

The 3 firms with the most employers registered for energy lobbying since 2019 are:
- Compass Government Relations Partners, LLC (10 employers)
- Perry White Ross & Jacobson (8 employers)
- Rifkin Weiner Livingston LLC (8 employers)

Next steps for this portions inlcude getting new data from the "Maryland Lobbying Registrations"-Website to look through "energy" employers and their spending.

```{r}
## The dataset has been cleaned in OpenRefine. We clean the names and split the date column, so we have a start and an end date for the registration.
energy_registrations <- read_csv("data/clean_energy-registrations.csv") %>% clean_names()
energy_registrations[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(energy_registrations$registration_period, '-', 2)
```

```{r}
## Then we transform our new colums from characters to dates and create a floor date to make grouping by year possible.
energy_registrations <- energy_registrations %>% 
  mutate(new_start = as.Date(start, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(new_end = as.Date(end, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(start_year = floor_date(new_start, "year")) %>% 
```

```{r}
## To make sure we don't count some lobbyists twice in a year (they do sometimes register multiple times for short periods in a year), we use n_distinct.
year_energy_registrations <- energy_registrations %>% 
  group_by(start_year) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(clean_lobbyist_registrant))
year_energy_registrations
```

```{r}
## We repeat the code, only this time we are looking for the number of employers lobbyists registered with.
year_energy_registrations <- energy_registrations %>% 
  group_by(start_year) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(clean_lobbyist_registrant))
year_energy_registrations
```

```{r}
## We want to know which firms had the most employers in our timeframe (2019-2022). We grouped by firms, counted employers and arranged the data.
employer_energy <- energy_registrations %>% 
  group_by(clean_organization_firm) %>% 
  summarise(count = n_distinct(clean_employer)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
employer_energy
```

```{r}
## Let's see who those firms work for
top_three <- energy_registrations %>% 
  filter(clean_organization_firm == c("Compass Government Relations Partners, LLC", "Perry White Ross & Jacobson", "Rifkin Weiner Livingston LLC")) %>% 
  select(clean_organization_firm, clean_employer) %>% 
  arrange(clean_organization_firm)
top_three
```
