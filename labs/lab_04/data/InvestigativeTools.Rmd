This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
ABrown <- read_csv('/Users/torrencebanks/Documents/GitHub/Fall-2022-Data-TB/labs/lab_04/data/ABrown_a_2022_10_13T22_28_58.csv')


```
```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
 Contribs<- ABrown %>% 
  group_by(contributor_name) %>% 
  count() 


```

```{r}
Acttwo <- ABrown %>% 
  filter(contributor_name == "ACTBLUE")
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
