## Introduction 

In this notebook, we are analysing data from the Maryland Lobbying Registrations. [https://lobby-ethics.maryland.gov/]

## Load libraries

Loading required libraries for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the tidyverse here
library(tidyverse)
# Load janitor here
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load and Cleaning Data

```{r}
# Load required data

# Path to data should be loaded from folder "data" i.e. read_csv("data/name_of_data.csv")

one <- read_csv("data/registrations(1).csv") %>% clean_names()
two <- read_csv("data/registrations(2).csv") %>% clean_names()
three <- read_csv("data/registrations(3).csv") %>% clean_names()
four<- read_csv("data/registrations(4).csv") %>% clean_names()
five <- read_csv("data/registrations(5).csv")%>% clean_names()
six <- read_csv("data/registrations(6).csv")%>% clean_names()
seven <- read_csv("data/registrations(7).csv")%>% clean_names()
eight <- read_csv("data/registrations(8).csv")%>% clean_names()
nine <- read_csv("data/registrations(9).csv")%>% clean_names()
```
**rbind is how you combine multiple dataframes.


```{r}
# Clean required data and prepare for analysis if needed. 

total_registrations <- rbind(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
write_csv(total_registrations, "data/total_registrations.csv")

clean_total_registrations <- read_csv("data/clean_total_registrations.csv")
clean_total_registrations[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(clean_total_registrations$registration_period, '-', 2)

```

## Basic explorations

```{r}
glimpse(clean_total_registrations)
```


*How many rows & columns?
*What are limitations & flaws?

The original dataframe had 12855 rows and 5 columns. Our cleaned dataframe has 12855 rows and 9 columns (we added cleaned columns for organization name & employer and split the date column to have a start and end date for the registration).

The data looked pretty clean in OpenRefine. We found just a handful of names to clean up.

Limitations: The dataframe is pretty basic with a small number of columns. That means we will have to cross-reference the website, if we want to know how much a lobbyist is making or how much an employer is spending on lobbying. The standard dataset doesn't even include the registration matters. For our topical questions, we have to download new datasets for every registration matter we're interested in. Another limitation is that the earliest data is from 2019, which means we can't look at long-term trends.

To answer most of our questions, we will have to do additional research. For example, we can ask the number of employers and lobbyists in the energy sector and see how that changed over the last few years. To examine how much the top firms make, we have to go back to the website.

When looking into the PG county youth curfew, we won't get clear cut answers from the data alone. Trying to find a connection between the number of lobbyists for matters of juvenile law and the implementation of the curfew will require additional research on our part.

### Question 1
* **Question text**:What lobbyist/registrant represents the most employers in our data set? (Most ever, need all data)

* **Analysis summary**:*Analysis summary**: The lobbyist that represents the most employers in our data set was Timothy A. Perry. He's been representing employers for 12 years as a member of Perry White Ross Jacobson LLC and served as Chief of Staff to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., the longest serving State Senate President in United States history. He lives in Baltimore County, Maryland.

```{r}
most_employers <- clean_total_registrations %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


```{r}
clean_total_registrations %>% 
  filter(lobbyist_registrant == "Perry, Timothy  A"
  )
```

```{r}
dupe_employers <- clean_total_registrations %>% 
   filter(lobbyist_registrant == "Perry, Timothy  A") %>% 
  count(clean_employer, source = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
distinct_employers <- clean_total_registrations %>% 
    group_by(lobbyist_registrant, clean_organization_firm, clean_employer) %>% 
  summarise(
    count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant, clean_organization_firm, clean_employer)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  count()
```

Firms with most employers: 
- Compass Government Relations Partners, LLC
- Perry White Ross & Jacobson
- Rifkin Weiner Livingston LLC

### Question 3

In the months leading up to the September 9th youth curfew in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, was there an increase in the amount of lobbyist registered for matters of juvenile law?

Revised question: How did the number of Criminal Law Procedure lobbyists registered change after the September 9th youth curfew in Prince George's County? 

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

```{r}
```

Criminal Law Procedure data set

```{r}
Criminal_Prod<- read_csv("data/CriminalLProd.csv") %>% clean_names()
Criminal_Prod[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(Criminal_Prod$registration_period, '-', 2)

NewCriminal_Prod <- Criminal_Prod %>% 
mutate(new_start = as.Date(start, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(new_end = as.Date(end, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(start_year = floor_date(new_start, "year")) %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant)
```
Compare: March2022 through August 2022 to September 2021 to February 2022

```{r}
SepttoFeb <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
filter(new_start == "2021-11-08" | new_start == "2021-11-01" |
new_start == "2022-02-08" | new_start == "2022-01-01" | new_start == "2021-12-06" | new_start == "2022-01-12" | new_start == "2022-01-24")
  
March22toAug <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(new_start == "2022-05-18" | new_start == "2022-08-11")

Sept22toNov <- NewCriminal_Prod %>% 
  filter(new_start == "2022-11-01" | new_start == "2022-11-07" | new_start == "2022-11-11" | new_start == "2022-11-02")
```

```{r}
CountSepttoFeb <- SepttoFeb %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))

CountMarch22toAug <- March22toAug %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))

CountSept22toNov <- Sept22toNov %>% 
  group_by(lobbyist_registrant) %>% 
  summarise(count= n_distinct(lobbyist_registrant))
```

The number of lobbyists that registered on or after September, 01 2021 through August 2022 for Criminal Law Procedure was 25 lobbyists (24 were from September 2021 to February 2022). From September, 01 2022 through November 2022, there were 19 registered lobbyists for Criminal Law Procedure.

I changed the initial question because based on the data that I choose, I didn't see how I would be able to see if there was a month by month increase or decrease. I also noticed that from March 2022 to August 2022, there were only two lobbyists that registered during that period of time. So I though that I should create a question that allows me to incorporate more data than just two lobbyists. 

Now that we know how the number of lobbyists has changed, it would be interesting to conduct more research and see if any of them have a connection to PG County at all. 

Question 4
* **Question text**: How did the number of employers and lobbyists in the energy sector change from 2018 to 2022?

Starting with the basic analysis of lobbyist registrations from the energy sector, we want to explore how lobbying efforts have changed in the past years. Follow-up questions include: Which firms had the most employers in our time frame? How much money did the top 3 firms make from employers in the energy sector (in 2022)? Who are their employers? Are they part of fossil fuels, clean energy or others?

* **Analysis summary**:

```{r}
energy_registrations <- read_csv("data/clean_energy-registrations.csv") %>% clean_names()
energy_registrations[c('start', 'end')] <- str_split_fixed(energy_registrations$registration_period, '-', 2)

```


```{r}
energy_registrations <- energy_registrations %>% 
  mutate(new_start = as.Date(start, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(new_end = as.Date(end, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(start_year = floor_date(new_start, "year")) %>% 
```

```{r}
year_energy_registrations <- energy_registrations %>% 
  group_by(start_year) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(clean_lobbyist_registrant))
year_energy_registrations
```

```{r}
employer_energy <- energy_registrations %>% 
  group_by(clean_organization_firm) %>% 
  summarise(count = n_distinct(clean_employer)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
employer_energy
```

```{r}

```
